### Hi there 👋

<!--
**haitam-skhairi/haitam-skhairi** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


After graduating from Abdul-Malik Al-Saadi University with a Bachelor's degree in Energy Sciences, Energy Physics Division, I was introduced to the field of programming and learned that programming is the future and that anyone can learn it.

It wasn't long before I decided to change my course and started learning to program. At the beginning of the quarantine in 2020, I participated in the Front and Devlopper course of the One Million Arab Coders Initiative and received an approved certificate from Udacity. I did some projects to apply what I learned. Since then I have learned new things and will never stop learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my career
- 🌱 I'm currently learning in track Front End development
- 🌍  I'm based in Tétouan, Morocco
- ✉️  You can contact me at haitamskhairi@gmail.com
- 🧠  I'm learning the front-end technologies and their implementation
- 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects as well as building new ideas
- ⚡  Chill and Code is somehow means the lifestyle, I love nature and relaxing in front of the sea...
